<p>The Lytro camera is the first consumer “light field camera.” It uses a new technology to create photos that can have their focus changed after they have been taken. Because of this, there is no need to auto-focus, resulting in virtually no shutter delay. Here’s how it works.</p>

<h2>Camera Overview</h2>

<p>A Lytro camera is made up of two sections. An anodized aluminum shell contains the lens assembly, while the electronics are housed within a silicone rubber grip.</p>

<h2>Capturing Light</h2>

<p>Lytro’s light field sensor captures not only the color, intensity and position of the light, but also its direction, which is lost in traditional cameras.</p>

<h2>Changing Focus</h2>

<p>Because all the directional information of the entering light is captured, software can change the focal plane. Clicking any point on the image brings that area into focus, whether raindrops on the surface of a window or buildings beyond.</p>

<h2>Light Field Sensor</h2>

<p>Consists of a standard digital camera CMOS sensor coupled with a micro-lens array. The array contains thousands of miniature lenses.</p>

<h2>Micro-Lens Array</h2>

<p>Tiny lenses divide the CMOS sensor’s pixels into multiple areas, each showing the image at a slightly different angle. Software uses this data to triangulate the image in 3-D space.</p>

<h2>Controlling the Camera</h2>

<p>Lytro uses a 1.46-inch touch screen. Swiping back and forth allows you to view previous or later photos, while swiping up brings up a menu bar. The shutter button and a slider for the zoom are molded into the top of the unit, while the power button and a USB connector are on the bottom.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/29/2821763/lytro-review">Lytro Review</a></p>

<p>Lytro是一家位于硅谷的创业公司，源于公司CEO Ren Ng在斯坦福的一项研究，其目标很简单：凭借其光场（light field）相机「硬件和软件」，Lytro可以从很多方面改变照相技术，因为有了它你无需对焦。</p>

<p>与此同时，这家公司的投资方包括Andreessen Horowitz和Greylock等知名投资机构，其技术团队包括Silicon Graphics联合创始人以及Palm webOS的首席架构师。那么Lytro的魅力到底在哪里呢？</p>

<p>答案是「光场（light field）照相」或者说「全光（plenoptic）照相」。Lytro背后的核心思维源于斯坦福的一篇论文「PDF文档」，原理非常简单。普通相机的工作原理和肉眼差不多，前面的镜头可以收集来自前方的光线，然后通过传感器上的光圈「单反相机上的硅胶套或眼睛里的视网膜」。为了聚焦眼睛或普通照相机，你通过不同方式调整镜头，以捕捉来自不同方向的光线，将其收集到传感器中。这会带来很多副作用，其中之一就是只能有一个焦点。这让问题变得复杂，当然如果手法得当的话可以拍出漂亮的照片。</p>

<p>但Lytro的技术之一就是在相机传感器前面布有大量微镜头。你可以把它们想象成苍蝇眼睛上的数千个微型镜头。其中的物理学和数学知识有点复杂，但最后的结果是这样的：相机传感器记录下的不是单一的图像「由镜头、光圈等设置决定」，Lytro相机可以用复杂的方式记录下来自前方场景各个部位的光线，而不仅仅是普通相机那样只能记下聚焦范围中的光线。然后Lytro软件会对图像进行解码。</p>

<p><embed src="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XMjc5NDc5NDY4/v.swf" allowFullScreen="true" quality="high" width="480" height="400" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></p>

<p>这就是神奇之处。因为这个系统可以捕捉有关场景光线方向的信息，因此它可以“聚焦”照片中的任何深度，哪怕在拍照后数年。一瞬间你就可以获得理想的照片，相机可以去掉笨重、耗电和昂贵的聚焦系统，你可以更快地完成拍照，即便非专业摄影师也不必担心对焦问题。镜头还可以捕捉弱光环境下的光线。这会产生很大的影响，可能会对整个相机业带来巨大变革。</p>

<p>这事听起来有点荒诞，但其结果经过证明，确是千真万确。一群材料学家发现，从工业玻璃中抽出极细的一根玻璃丝，可以用来储藏和释放惊人的电量。把玻璃丝夹在两块金属板之间用作为电容器的一部分，该玻璃丝可为像心脏震颤器等设备提供大量的能量，甚至可以为新一代电动汽车提供能量。</p>

<p>Here's something that sounds preposterous but as it turns out, it's actually true. Take a very thinly drawn piece of industrial glass, and you can use it to store and release a surprising amount of electricity, a group of materials scientists has found. When sandwiched between two metal plates as part of a device called a capacitor, the glass slivers could provide large bursts of energy for devices such as heart defibrillators, and they could even help power the next generation of electric vehicles.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Usually a rectangular plate of material, capacitors are essential to electronics because they can perform tasks that batteries can't. Each contains a material called a dielectric, which can store electrical energy and then release it in a large burst. Capacitors are much faster than batteries at charging and releasing electricity, which makes them ideal for providing the pulses of power required by camera flashes and diesel engine starters. They can also endure millions of cycles of charging and discharging, compared to mere thousands of cycles for conventional rechargeable batteries.</p>

<p>To meet the power demands of modern devices, researchers have been looking for materials that can store more and more electricity. That's where the use of industrial glass comes in. Industrial glass is stronger and more durable than the glass in household windowpanes and mirrors, and it's more resistant to repeated chemical reactions. Materials scientists at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, have now found that an extremely thin piece of the industrial glass called barium boroaluminosilicate--which is used in flat-panel TV displays--can hold more than twice as much electrical charge as polypropylene, which is currently the most common material for high-energy capacitors.</p>

<p>Reporting online this week in Materials Letters, the researchers say they used samples of the glass about 50 micrometers thick, or about half the diameter of a human hair, which they etched in acid until the samples eroded to a thickness of only 10 to 20 micrometers. Then they hooked the samples to two electrodes and applied an increasing voltage to test the material's breakdown strength: its ability to withstand electrical energy. When the material reached this breakdown limit--at about 22,000 volts--the stored energy was released in what resembles "a lightning bolt conducting through air," says co-author Nicholas Smith.</p>

<p>The ability of the glass to hold so much charge renders it "of prime interest to people who make capacitors and other energy storage devices," Smith says. He adds that the low cost of the material adds to its attractiveness, because researchers have been looking mainly at materials, such as specialty polymers and nanocomposites, that tend to be more expensive.</p>

<p>This could be a breakthrough, says chemical engineer Richard Wool of the University of Delaware, Newark. Wool, who specializes in the chemistry of glass, says the ability of the material to combine high energy storage and high breakdown strength, as well as its low cost, gives it an advantage over currently used materials.</p>

<p>This is the rare moment a beautiful rainbow and violent storm cloud came head to head creating a stunning scene high in the sky.
As the monster tornado began to dominate the skies over Colorado, USA, most people would have been locking their doors and windows.
But as the threat diminished one lucky group of storm chasers saw the rare sight of a rainbow and tornado seemingly just a few miles apart.</p>

Rare sight: As the monster tornado began to dominate the skies over Colorado, USA, most people would have been locking their doors and windows, but one lucky group of storm chasers saw the rare sight of a rainbow and tornado</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The magnificent moment was captured by dedicated Dutch storm chaser Peter Gude, 47, who couldn't believe his eyes as he spotted the unusual scene.</p>

<p>With the month of March looming, United States tornado chasers are already watching the Southeast as a nasty storm brews with the potential to spin off a batch of tornadoes.</p>

<p>But if funnel clouds develop Thursday or Friday as some forecasters believe, they won't be the first.</p>

<p>This tornado season got an early and deadly start in late January when two people were killed by separate twisters in Alabama.</p>

<p>Preliminary reports showed 95 tornadoes struck last month, compared with 16 in January during a particularly stormy 2011.</p>

<p>The season usually starts in March and then ramps up for the next couple of months, but forecasting these storm seasons is even more imprecise than predicting hurricane seasons.</p>

<p>Tornadoes are too small and too short-lived for scientists to make seasonal predictions.</p>

<p>They don't develop like blizzards and hurricanes, which are easier to project.</p>

<p>They pop in and pop out. The storms that give them birth may last only a few hours. Hurricanes and blizzards are lumbering beasts that spend days moving across the satellite maps.</p>

<p>When a hurricane approaches, coastlines get days warning to evacuate.</p>

<p>With a tornado, if the weather service can let people know 20 minutes in advance, it's considered a victory.</p>

<p>'The Joplin (Missouri) tornado (that killed 158 people last May) wasn't violent until just about the time it got to the hospital," said Harold Brooks, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Severe Storms Laboratory, in Norman, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>'Even when you're in the field, there are still times when you're surprised by the intensity of the event and how quickly it started.'</p>

<p>If a forecast for a hurricane or blizzard is off by a mile, it's still bad weather. But a mile difference means no damage in a tornado, Brooks said: 'It's so much finer in time and space on the tornado, it does make it a harder problem.'</p>

<p>It takes a piece of debris only a few seconds to fly around an entire tornado; it takes hours to circle a hurricane. But tornadoes, though smaller, can have stronger winds.</p>

<p>Since 1950, there have been 58 tornadoes in the U.S. with winds exceeding 200 mph; six last year alone. Only three hurricanes have made U.S. landfall with winds more than 155 mph.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ol>
<li><p>Magnetism is familiar to every fifth grader, but describing it can confound even the most brilliant physicist.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. When asked to explain magnetism, he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM">urged his BBC interviewer to take it on faith</a> (video). After seven minutes of stonewalling, he finally said, “I really can’t do a good job, any job, of explaining magnetic force in terms of something else that you’re more familiar with because I don’t understand it in terms of anything else that you’re more familiar with.”</p></li>
</ol>


<!--more-->


<ol>
<li><p>He did break down and try for a few seconds before abandoning the attempt. Those seconds were packed with oversimplifications: “All the electrons [in a magnet] are spinning in the same direction.”</p></li>
<li><p>But who better than Feynman would have known that not all electrons spin in the same direction?</p></li>
<li><p>And they don’t actually spin. “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28physics%29">Spin</a>” is just a physicist’s term for the little magnetic north and south poles baked into every electron. The orientation of those poles defines the direction of the electron’s (somewhat imaginary) rotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does every electron have those poles? As soon as someone finds out, we’ll get back to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is what we do know. Within an atom, each electron is usually paired with an opposite- oriented electron so that their magnetic pulls cancel each other out.</p></li>
<li><p>But if some of the electrons are unpaired, they can be induced to move around so that their poles line up, creating a net magnetic field. The arrangement of the electrons in metals makes them particularly open to magnetic peer pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>DIY refrigerator magnet: Apply an external magnetic field to some hot metal. Cool it so the aligned electrons get frozen in place. Slap on your local plumber’s business card, and—voilà!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/653297/yinyang">Yin Seeks Yang</a> for Magnetic Relationship. All magnets have north and south poles, and opposite poles attract: North poles seek south poles seek north poles seek south poles seek . . .</p></li>
<li><p>You are standing on a magnet right now. The earth’s magnetic field is created by electric currents in an ocean of molten iron at its core. That’s why the north pole of a compass needle points . . . er . . . why north? Since north poles are attracted to south poles, the “north” arrow on your compass actually points toward the earth’s south magnetic pole, which is the one up north. Got it?</p></li>
<li><p>And the earth’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole">magnetic south</a> (aka “north”) pole isn’t even precisely at the geographic north pole. Right now it is in the Arctic Ocean, near northern Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>Worse still, it is constantly drifting in response to currents in the earth’s core. It is moving toward Siberia at a rate of up to 35 miles per year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Hey, shift happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Ancient mariners navigated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone">lodestone</a>, naturally occurring magnetic rocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Where lodestones come from is another mystery of magnetism. Some geologists think they are created when lighting strikes iron-rich rocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Microbes, birds, and some other animals have magnetic crystals inside their bodies that allow them to orient themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>That is probably why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle">loggerhead turtles</a> can migrate 8,000 miles in unfamiliar waters while humans can get lost looking for the restroom at Olive Garden.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</a> (MRI) machines generate a field 60,000 times as intense as the earth’s to vibrate the hydrogen atoms in your body; in response, the atoms emit radio waves that are analyzed to produce a map of your insides.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a sensor the size of a sugar cube, researchers from the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/index.html">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> can <a href="http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/magnetic_101310.cfm">track the magnetic pattern of a human heart</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The signal is faint, but the good news is that science has proved attraction is quantifiable. Word up, Hallmark.</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A water layer was sprinkled with Thymol Blue, which established the Marangoni convection responsible for the evident fine-scale texture. The layer was lit from below, giving the flow a natural luminescence. Stopping vortices shed during the deceleration phase of the strider's motion are evident in Figure 2.  The dipolar vortices shed by the driving legs during each stroke are evident in Figure 3, and mark the path of the strider. The starburst in Figure 3 is associated with the relatively large particle of thymol blue evident at its centre: the Thymol Blue reduces the local surface tension, thus prompting surface divergence that clears the surface of blue dye.  The water striders are light-seeking, and so drawn to the starbursts.</p>
