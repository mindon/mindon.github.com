<p>The Lytro camera is the first consumer “light field camera.” It uses a new technology to create photos that can have their focus changed after they have been taken. Because of this, there is no need to auto-focus, resulting in virtually no shutter delay. Here’s how it works.</p>

<h2>Camera Overview</h2>

<p>A Lytro camera is made up of two sections. An anodized aluminum shell contains the lens assembly, while the electronics are housed within a silicone rubber grip.</p>

<p>这事听起来有点荒诞，但其结果经过证明，确是千真万确。一群材料学家发现，从工业玻璃中抽出极细的一根玻璃丝，可以用来储藏和释放惊人的电量。把玻璃丝夹在两块金属板之间用作为电容器的一部分，该玻璃丝可为像心脏震颤器等设备提供大量的能量，甚至可以为新一代电动汽车提供能量。</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s something that sounds preposterous but as it turns out, it&rsquo;s actually true. Take a very thinly drawn piece of industrial glass, and you can use it to store and release a surprising amount of electricity, a group of materials scientists has found. When sandwiched between two metal plates as part of a device called a capacitor, the glass slivers could provide large bursts of energy for devices such as heart defibrillators, and they could even help power the next generation of electric vehicles.</p>

    <div slot="summary"><css-style/><hr />

<p>投资过剩，房产泡沫，政府负债，银行坏账。 昌盛的国家各有各的繁华，而危机笼罩下的国家，却都是相似的。 都是些老生常谈，争来争去逃不出了钱字。 作者虽非经济学专业人士，但也详尽阐述了一个西方人对于中国经济的看法。
【译言网】全文: <a href="https://select.yeeyan.org/view/205314/255491">时代周刊：为什么中国将发生经济危机</a></p>

<p>The view in most of the world is that China is indestructible. Shrugging off the crises multiplying elsewhere, China seems to surge from strength to strength, its spectacular growth marching on no matter what headwinds may come. It appears inevitable that China will overtake a U.S. mired in debt and division to become the world’s indispensable economy. Those businessmen and policymakers looking to the future believe China’s “state capitalism” may be a superior form of economic organization in dealing with the challenges of the modern global economy.</p>

<p>My answer to all of this is: think again.</p>

<p>I don’t doubt for a second that China will be a major economic superpower with an increasingly influential role in the global economy. In many respects, it already is a superpower. But that doesn’t mean the economy is free from problems, a good number of them created by the very statist system lauded by pundits in the U.S. and Europe. And in my opinion, if China doesn’t change course, and in a big way, the country will experience an economic crisis.</p>

    <div slot="summary"><css-style/><p><strong>M</strong>y mother always talked to me a lot about the sky. She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night&hellip;especially the stars. We would play a game sometimes; a game called &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Beyond the Sky?&rdquo; We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn&rsquo;t know how to name. But of course, that was just a game. There&rsquo;s nothing beyond the sky. The sky just is, and it goes on and on, and we play all of our games beneath it.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>eople are lonely in this world for lots of different reasons. Some people have something in their disposition. Maybe they were just born too mean, or maybe they were born too tender. But most people are brought to where they are by circumstance, by calamity or a broken heart or something else happening in their lives that wasn&rsquo;t anything they planned on. People are lonely in this world for lots of different reasons. The one thing that I do know is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what any one of them might tell you&ndash;nobody wants to be alone.</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>ome people have given up all hope of anything in their lives every changing. They just go on with it day by day, and if something were to come along and make things different they probably wouldn&rsquo;t even notice it right off, except for that kind of nervous feeling you get in your stomach. My mom and I used to call that &ldquo;the car trip feeling&rdquo;, because it was how I&rsquo;d feel whenever I knew we were going to go somewhere far away or something new.</p>
