    <div slot="summary"><p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Jared-Rosoff">Jared Rosoff</a></p>

<p>Each logical db has its own set of files in your dbpath. You can find them as <dbname>.<file_number>. If you&rsquo;re using directory-per-db option, then they may be in separate directories.</p>

<p>The dbfiles themselves are broken up into extents. Each extent is assigned to a namespace and contains data for that namespace. Each collection is its own namespace. Also each Index is its own namespace.</p>

<p>Documents in a collection are stored as a doubly linked list within extents. The document itself is formatted as BSON. There is a header that has, among other things, pointers to the next and previous document in the collection.</p>

<p>Index data is also stored in these files, but they are stored as B-Tree&rsquo;s rather than doubly linked lists.</p>

<p>There is also a namespace file that contains namespace (collections, indexes, freelist) meta data and how they map to their extents.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re running with journaling enabled, then there is also a set of journal files that contain a history of changes to collection data.</p>

<p>When I finished watching this video at noon, I visit the speaker&rsquo;s Google+. There I see this sentence as his motto</p>

<p><strong>Colt McAnlis</strong> &ndash; &ldquo;If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the first time I met the word: <strong>absurd</strong>!</p>

<p>Another article “Man, give it five minutes.”</p>

<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.</p>

<p>Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.</p>

<p>So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.</p>

<h2>Working on TikTalk</h2>

<p>This time, when we start a new product. I need a name for it: I choose tiktalk hoping the product could be someting like a drop of water in the ocean of internet: providing a kind of driving force of a website&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>A name for product is importance to express our idea, activate our creative power to push it forward. (I learn this from the global mail project last year.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hard work during these 3 weeks:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Design the front-end &amp; back-end frameworks</p></li>

<li><p>Setup service of back-end</p></li>

<li><p>Rewrite front-end codes</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Today, finish front-end demo: a few features in detail, fixing bugs&hellip;</p>

<p>TikTalk is working fine! :-)</p>

<p>Next week, making back-end service more stable &amp; flexible is big challenge for me.</p>

    <div slot="summary"><p>Laser light can not only trigger lightning but redirect it, causing it to strike in the same place over and over, according to new research. This means lasers could serve as lightning rods. Because that would be awesome.</p>

<p>Laser lightning rods have been a research subject for several decades, because they could trigger lightning and guide it to a specific place. Firing a laser would create an ionized channel in the atmosphere, which could conduct the lightning to the ground. Laser lightning rods could be an alternative to lightning rockets, according to Aurlien Houard of the Laboratoire d&rsquo;Optique Appliquée in Palaiseau, France, a co-author of this study. Lightning rockets can apparently trigger a lightning strike by bringing a conductive material, like some type of salts, toward the static layer of a thunderhead. But a laser would be easier to control than a rocket.</p>

<p>A team of French researchers set out to test how well lasers can harness and control lightning. They sent a laser beam past a spherical electrode toward an oppositely charged flat electrode. The laser stripped away the outer electrons from the atoms in its way, ionizing the pathway between the electrodes and creating a plasma filament — like lab lightning — that channeled an electrical discharge from the flat electrode to the spherical one.</p>

<p>Then the team added a longer, pointed electrode to their set of electrode shapes and watched what happened. Left to its own devices, lightning follows the path of least resistance, striking the first thing it comes across — in a thunderstorm, that’s the tallest thing, and in this experiment, it’s the nearest thing. With no laser lightning rod, the discharge predictably hit the tall pointed electrode first. But when the researchers used the laser filament to guide it, the electrical discharge followed the ionized path and hit the spherical electrode instead.</p>

<p>The team found they could pull this off even after the discharge was already on its way, meaning they could divert the path of lightning. The research appears in the American Institute of Physics journal <a href="http://aipadvances.aip.org/resource/1/aaidbi/v2/i1/p012151_s1?bypassSSO=1">AIP Advances</a>.</p>

    <div slot="summary"><h2>Passion</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes when you give an impressionable young mind (anybody deciding to learn to code, age is irrelevant) two tools and a problem, they will use the two tools to create four more tools. Then they will get on the internets and find some more tools … soon they have twenty tools and what was the problem you wanted me to solve again?</p>

<p>That’s passion!</p>

<p>Pure unadulterated passion for programming. When you can be fascinated, even excited, about this stuff without a need to solve a problem. Hell, even if you are solving a problem that you know is a meaningless exercise … that’s where greatness lies.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter what age you started coding at – many studies have shown experience is not a predictor of quality in our world – what matters is that you have a passion for this stuff.</p>

<p>Because if you’ve got the passion, then you probably have everything else you need as well.</p>

    <div slot="summary"><p>Independently of what transport you are using (WebSocket or Comet or both), a connection can always be closed by a Proxy or Firewall, or an expected network outage can close your connection. Why is it a problem? It’s problematic when a disconnection happens as you may loose server side events if you don’t architect your application correctly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>long-polling</strong>: between reconnection, servers side events may happens and if they aren’t persisted, those events will never reach your client.</li>
<li><strong>websocket</strong>: Websocket are new and most if not all firewall will close them after some X idle times. Again, all server sides events will be lost</li>
<li><strong>http-streaming</strong>: Some proxy really don’t like the http-streaming technique, and will close it right away. Again, possibility to loose server sides events.</li>
<li><strong>Unexpected network outage</strong>: the connection can also be closed by something between your browser and server.</li>
