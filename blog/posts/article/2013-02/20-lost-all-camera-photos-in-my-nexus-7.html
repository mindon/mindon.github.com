    <h1 slot="title">Lost All Camera Photos in My Nexus 7</h1>
    <div slot="content"><style>img,embed,iframe{max-width:100%}code{max-width:100%;overflow-x:auto}</style><p>My 8G Nexus 7, No rooted, Updated to android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 at 18 Feb.</p>

<p>Now all photos in folder DCIM/Camera, were lost - Now way to restore currently, and vanish in the air.</p>

<p>The first lost was found yesterday, there were only 5 photos left.</p>

<p>The day, I debug an simple PhoneGap app in android with Developer Mode and USB debugging turned on.</p>

<p>When I reach my PC at home, connected the device with USB cable, turned on Developer Mode and USB debugging. And try a few restore software, but all failed to show the &ldquo;Internal Storage&rdquo;, so I gave up. But then I found the photos lost again - only one photo file left now. What the hell happened?</p>

<p>Today, I tried to find out a solution, but nothing could help.</p>

<p>At last, turn on the photo sync and backup the two large thumbdata in folder DCIM/.thumbnails/, one is 303MB, another one is 1.01GB.</p>

<p>My photos! Vanish in Nexus 7 updated to Jelly Bean 4.2.2 and Google could not provide any help on it.</p>
