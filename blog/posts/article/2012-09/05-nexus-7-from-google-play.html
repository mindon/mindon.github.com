    <h1 slot="title">Nexus 7 Issues</h1>
    <div slot="content"><style>img,embed,iframe{max-width:100%}</style><p>I bought <strong>Nexus 7</strong> from a online shop on <strong>taobao</strong> at July. It was got from Google Play from US.</p>

<p>An android device with hardware: NFC, GPS, Camera, Motion detect, &hellip; latest app from Google, that is what I want.</p>

<p>I got my Nexus 7 before August. I love it before and when I touch it. It looks great, runs fast &amp; smooth.</p>

<p>And I still love it now, even it will be ill sometimes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Screen Touch Problem</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work well sometimes, and could be fixed by switching it to sleep mode and wake it back immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot see and run Google Play Books outside US.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did not activate the device with an US VPN, that made these Books &amp; Magazine disabled from Nexus 7. It make me very upset. But I don&rsquo;t want to root it any way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flicker when wifi signal is poor</li>
</ul>

<p>At first, I thought it was from the auto-adjust of the lightness. But Google result tells me, the poor wifi makes it happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>Zero power status</li>
</ul>

<p>When its power is zero, the charging does not help the device start. Maybe there&rsquo;s some problem to charge the battery, 10 minutes charge does not help. Nexus 7 cannot start sometimes in low power.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fail to start when poor power, even charging</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe battery charge is failed, After the Nexus 7 ( It&rsquo;s hard to make it sometimes ), the screen turns into scratch lines &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nexus/n7-dash.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Slow battery charge</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, problem 4. and 5. found. and another issue is 8 hours charging (USB then Plug) only reaches to 65%&hellip; :-(</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/nexus/n7-charge.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>It seems the screen working fine when the battery with 10%+ power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with these problems, It&rsquo;s still an amazing android device for me.</p>

<p>Maybe WP8 tablet could be better, or Kindle Fire 2 may be better. But the Nexus 7 is still a device worth to own.</p>
