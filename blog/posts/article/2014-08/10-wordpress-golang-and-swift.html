    <div slot="content"><style>img,embed,iframe{max-width:100%}code{max-width:100%;overflow-x:auto}</style><p>&ldquo;WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. We like to say that WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time.&rdquo;  &ndash; <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s welcomed worldwide with lots of themes and plugins to enpower its features and functions. WordPress has more than ten years history. But I setup and got into its details only at the end of June this year.</p>

<p>Customize one of its theme to our style, separated it into two versions - one is readonly without admin features as the live product for public, the other is the full version accessible only for internal network.</p>

<p>Cache, Share to facebook and sitemap.xml for SEO is also important features you cannot miss.</p>

<p>Make the blog online in 2 weeks, fixing bugs, improve SEO and share time to time in another 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Now, simple plugins, update themes, shortcode features, wordpress editor - tinymce plugin, facebook share metas &hellip; that&rsquo;s what i got from the one month project with WordPress. It&rsquo;s great to get such a project to get into WordPress, from its apache/nginx settings, .htaccess controls to some coding details all by myself.

<p>At the same time, I got another opportunity to practise <a href="http://golang.org">Go Language</a>. It&rsquo;s a simple internal management website with uploads, mysql database operation, oa authorization, handling JSON and sessions.</p>

<p>My first practice on golang is <strong>tof</strong> &ndash; a simple library to implement OA APIs of our company. In fact, it&rsquo;s a golang version from my former nodejs version.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Notify Me&rdquo; in golang works like a charm. I enjoy coding in go.</p>

<p>I cannot stop learning those wonderful programming techs. I&rsquo;m reading on the Swift book on iBook. There&rsquo;s lots of coding styles of Swift and Golang are alike. As a Front-End JavaScript developer, It&rsquo;s a enjoyment.</p>

<p>Any opportunity to practise the Swift? I&rsquo;m so sure there will be one :-)</p>

<p>I like Golang, maybe Swift too!</p>
