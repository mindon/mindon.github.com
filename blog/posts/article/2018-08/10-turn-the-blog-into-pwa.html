    <h1 slot="title">Turn the blog into PWA</h1>
    <div slot="content"><style>img,embed,iframe{max-width:100%}</style><p>Here&rsquo;s comes my first online PWA: Progressive Web App</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long way from playing Polymer 2.0 to using Polymer 3.0 beta to rebuild my very old blog here on the github pages.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I don&rsquo;t like mass of dependencies from npm install. The pwa-starter-kit of polymer 3.0 requires lots of dev packages to help the process of developing a WPA app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d built a docker images to keep all the resources to develop Polymer 3.0 apps. With it the mass packages inside node_modules/ could be reused for a new project - to avoid the time-costing process of npm install.</p>

<p>From a simple built demo, find out changes from the source code version - then I could play the Polymer 3.0 app development with a simple editor again :-)</p>

<p>Finally, using only ~25MB node_modules/ make it works - instead of using a 200+MB monster.</p>

<p>Nowdays, web is being much complex with more syntaxes and rules  - TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, Polymer, Dart, ES6 &hellip;</p>

<p>Worse, there&rsquo;s all kinds of build tools - WebPack, gulp, grunt, bower, npm, rollup &hellip;</p>

<p>Worst, I&rsquo;m aging as web front-end developer. I&rsquo;m still enjoying web development! :-D</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/tech-focused.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This month, my work position switched from web front-end develop to data analysis. Keep working in learning Machine Learning last more than 20 months - Reading AI papers, using Spark, Kafka, Hive, HBase, PostgresQL, Docker - and programming in scala, python, golang &hellip;</p>

<p>The future is more complex and harder than I thought, I&rsquo;m walking forward, facing any challenges.</p>

<p>BTW, the PWA with polymer looks great. And I may try some Flutter apps later. And Expecting the new OS - Fuchsia from Google.</p>
