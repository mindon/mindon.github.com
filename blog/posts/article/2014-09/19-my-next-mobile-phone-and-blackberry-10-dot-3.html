    <h1 slot="title">My Next Mobile Phone and BlackBerry 10.3</h1>
    <div slot="content"><style>img,embed,iframe{max-width:100%}code{max-width:100%;overflow-x:auto}</style><p>Yesterday, I updated my BlackBerry Q10 Dev Device to BlackBerry OS 10.3.0.738, It was from the 10.3.0.1154 autoloader.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s flat styled - it looks much better.</p>

<p>But its camera shot method is changed to an android style, it&rsquo;s bad - it&rsquo;s a great part of the camera in BlackBerry 10 devices. Taking photo and its NFC are the features I enjoy everyday.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m using a BlackBerry mobile phone, a dev device not for sell. Last mobile phone I bought for myself is a Nokia, now it&rsquo;s such a tiny one. Here they are</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always waitting for my next mobile phone.</p>

<p>iPhone? Yes, it&rsquo;s a great mobile phone, but I still find no reason for it - at least there&rsquo;s not enough reasons right now. Even the iPhone 6 - hmm, It&rsquo;s great and with a high price and not sell in China mainland yet :)</p>

<p>I was planning to buy a Nexus 4, then a Moto X, then a Next 5&hellip;</p>

<p>Google services is blocked in mainland China.</p>

<p>You may say a VPN may works - but I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>You may say a hosts with a rooted device works - But I don&rsquo;t like it either.</p>

<p>Before a mobile device hit my heart, I will still prefer my dev version BlackBerry Q10.</p>

<p>I have a Nexus 7(2013) and a Kindle, they are awesome devices.</p>

<p>But choosing a mobile phone, I could wait.</p>
