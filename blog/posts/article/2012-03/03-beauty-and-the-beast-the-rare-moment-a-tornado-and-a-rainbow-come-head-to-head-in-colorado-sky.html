<p>This is the rare moment a beautiful rainbow and violent storm cloud came head to head creating a stunning scene high in the sky.
As the monster tornado began to dominate the skies over Colorado, USA, most people would have been locking their doors and windows.
But as the threat diminished one lucky group of storm chasers saw the rare sight of a rainbow and tornado seemingly just a few miles apart.</p>

Rare sight: As the monster tornado began to dominate the skies over Colorado, USA, most people would have been locking their doors and windows, but one lucky group of storm chasers saw the rare sight of a rainbow and tornado

<p>The magnificent moment was captured by dedicated Dutch storm chaser Peter Gude, 47, who couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes as he spotted the unusual scene.</p>

<p>With the month of March looming, United States tornado chasers are already watching the Southeast as a nasty storm brews with the potential to spin off a batch of tornadoes.</p>

<p>But if funnel clouds develop Thursday or Friday as some forecasters believe, they won&rsquo;t be the first.</p>

<p>This tornado season got an early and deadly start in late January when two people were killed by separate twisters in Alabama.</p>

<p>Preliminary reports showed 95 tornadoes struck last month, compared with 16 in January during a particularly stormy 2011.</p>

<p>The season usually starts in March and then ramps up for the next couple of months, but forecasting these storm seasons is even more imprecise than predicting hurricane seasons.</p>

<p>Tornadoes are too small and too short-lived for scientists to make seasonal predictions.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t develop like blizzards and hurricanes, which are easier to project.</p>

<p>They pop in and pop out. The storms that give them birth may last only a few hours. Hurricanes and blizzards are lumbering beasts that spend days moving across the satellite maps.</p>

<p>When a hurricane approaches, coastlines get days warning to evacuate.</p>

<p>With a tornado, if the weather service can let people know 20 minutes in advance, it&rsquo;s considered a victory.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Joplin (Missouri) tornado (that killed 158 people last May) wasn&rsquo;t violent until just about the time it got to the hospital,&rdquo; said Harold Brooks, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s National Severe Storms Laboratory, in Norman, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Even when you&rsquo;re in the field, there are still times when you&rsquo;re surprised by the intensity of the event and how quickly it started.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If a forecast for a hurricane or blizzard is off by a mile, it&rsquo;s still bad weather. But a mile difference means no damage in a tornado, Brooks said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so much finer in time and space on the tornado, it does make it a harder problem.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It takes a piece of debris only a few seconds to fly around an entire tornado; it takes hours to circle a hurricane. But tornadoes, though smaller, can have stronger winds.</p>

<p>Since 1950, there have been 58 tornadoes in the U.S. with winds exceeding 200 mph; six last year alone. Only three hurricanes have made U.S. landfall with winds more than 155 mph.</p>
