    <h1 slot="title">LISP, PhoneGap and TAKEN DOWN</h1>
    <div slot="content"><style>img,embed,iframe{max-width:100%}code{max-width:100%;overflow-x:auto}</style><p>Learning GO language a few weeks before. Now the LISP.</p>

<p>Scheme is a dialect of Lisp that stresses conceptual elegance and simplicity.</p>

<p>The definition of Scheme tells what attracts me to learn this language. It is what it describes.</p>

<p>I spared a few hours learning from <a href="http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/">How to Design Programs</a> with exercises. Another great book from MIT <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html">Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs</a>.</p>

<p>DrRacket: <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">http://racket-lang.org/</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have any chances to use it. Go and Node.JS are enough.</p>

<p>On the other way, I learn to setup PhoneGap env. in my computer at home. And my first android app demo runs in my Nexus 7. I will put it here soon instead of Google Play.</p>

<p>And this morning, I got an E-mail from Google Chrome Web Store &ndash; Removal Notification for &ldquo;Ingress Portals Finder&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your Google Chrome item, &ldquo;Ingress Portals Finder,&rdquo; did not comply with our policies on Prohibited Products and was removed from the Google Chrome Web Store.
<!--more--></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a pity. It&rsquo;s the most welcome extension of my works. It just reached 4k+ installation before its removal.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the TAKEN DOWN.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t stress much on the Ingress server, instead, it will less stress.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>high quality developed.</p></li>

<li><p>welcome and really useful with nice UI.</p></li>

<li><p>avoid variety tool versions with almost same functions, controllable third-party tool entrance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But it&rsquo;s true, NO PERMISSION from ingress.com to allow me to call its one API.</p>

<p>But, what if my extension is a customized browser?  Display websites better that it is, should I need permissions from all the websites being improved? (I really could make such a customized browser :p)</p>

<p>No matter what, I&rsquo;m on the way to my next app, useful and helpful with UI satisfy me first.</p>
