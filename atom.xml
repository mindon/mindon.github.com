    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>穴位按摩有多种方法．常用的有按、拿、推、揉等，并不是每个身体部位适合所有的方法，需要根据病症不同，选择相应的刺激方法。</p>

<h2>掌平推法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：手掌在身体部位上做直线单方向移动。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：力道缓和，接触身体面积大，慢慢平推，使手掌的热度传至皮肤。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：行气活血，多用于治疗腰腿痛，肩背痛，颈椎病，胸腹胀痛等症。</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>指按法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：用指腹由轻到重，逐渐用力按压在被按摩的穴位上。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：适合全身各处的穴位，有通经活络，放松肌肉的作用。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：用食指按压，中指叠放在食指上，这样中指起到了很好的固定作用。</p>

<h2>四指摩法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：四指并拢，用指腹在相应的部位上，有规律地来回摩动。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：提高皮肤温度，加速血液循环，散淤消肿，调理脾胃，理气和中。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：摩法非常轻柔，在按摩开始和结束的时候采用，让人感受不到压力，放松心情。</p>

<h2>指揉法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：手指指腹在局部皮肤做轻柔和缓的回旋揉动。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：可增强肌肉和真皮组织的弹性，并具有活血散淤，缓解痉挛，减轻疼痛的作用。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：按揉穴位时，应略感到疼痛，这样是深压缓揉，保健效果会更好。</p>

<h2>拿捏法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：手掌和手指挤压身体部位。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：减少皮下脂肪，振奋精神，疏通经络，祛风散寒。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：双手深抓肉，像拧毛巾一样向两个方向用力，此法有减少皮下脂肪的作用。</p>

<h2>扣打法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：两手自然并拢，在按摩部位上轻轻拍打。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：促进气血运行，消除疲劳和调节神经肌肉兴奋性。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：轻拍是腕关节带动手掌拍打，重拍是以肘关节带动，不要用力过大。</p>

<h2>抖法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：双手或单手握住肢体末端，微微用力连续做小幅度的上下抖动。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：抖法能够很好地放松疲劳的肌肉，灵活僵硬的关节。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：肢体抖动时如波浪一样，由末端逐步传到身体中心。</p>

<h2>指叩法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：指尖、拳背、掌侧小鱼际击打一定部位。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：疏通经络，活血化淤，安神醒脑。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：除了用手指叩击，还可以借用一些工具如按摩棒等，击打手无法触及的部位。</p>

<h2>拳击法</h2>

<p><strong>方法</strong>：双手自然握拳，利用手腕的力量击打身体部位。</p>

<p><strong>功效</strong>：促进血液循环，镇定神经。</p>

<p><strong>小技巧</strong>：击打疼痛部位时，力度要适中，但击打松弛的肌肉时就要增加力度了。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>M</strong>y mother always talked to me a lot about the sky. She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night&#8230;especially the stars. We would play a game sometimes; a game called &#8220;What&#8217;s Beyond the Sky?&#8221; We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn&#8217;t know how to name. But of course, that was just a game. There&#8217;s nothing beyond the sky. The sky just is, and it goes on and on, and we play all of our games beneath it.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>eople are lonely in this world for lots of different reasons. Some people have something in their disposition. Maybe they were just born too mean, or maybe they were born too tender. But most people are brought to where they are by circumstance, by calamity or a broken heart or something else happening in their lives that wasn&#8217;t anything they planned on. People are lonely in this world for lots of different reasons. The one thing that I do know is, it doesn&#8217;t matter what any one of them might tell you&#8211;nobody wants to be alone.</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>ome people have given up all hope of anything in their lives every changing. They just go on with it day by day, and if something were to come along and make things different they probably wouldn&#8217;t even notice it right off, except for that kind of nervous feeling you get in your stomach. My mom and I used to call that &#8220;the car trip feeling&#8221;, because it was how I&#8217;d feel whenever I knew we were going to go somewhere far away or something new.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><strong>T</strong>hat summer, a lot of things had happened that people couldn&#8217;t explain. There had been lights in the sky and stories in the paper about saucers crashing. John had come, and then he had gone. For a while, life went back to being life, and almost everyone forgot the things that that summer had brought with it from out of the sky.</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hen you&#8217;re a kid, all you ever want is for the stories your mom reads you to be true. You think you can crawl inside the world that&#8217;s in every book and live in the pictures on every page, but deep down you know that this isn&#8217;t something that could ever happen. And it&#8217;s knowing that the magic isn&#8217;t quite there, that it&#8217;s just over the next hill or maybe in the next story, that makes you feel safe in your bed at night. You really wouldn&#8217;t want it to be any other way.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>here are times when it seems like the whole world is afraid&#8230;when the fear is something you have to live with day in day out. When people get scared, they do a lot of different things. They fight, or they run, they destroy the thing they&#8217;re afraid of, or they put a lot of distance between it and them&#8230;make it something you can shoot at with a friction-action gun.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>y father liked to say that there were these things in life that didn&#8217;t make any sense, and they could never make any sense, and if you were anywhere near smart, you knew that. But your job was not to give up, to keep on trying to make sense out of them anyway, trying to understand things that could never be understood. I guess maybe people will always find different names for their answers, but the one thing is, their questions will always be the same.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>hristmas is all about hope. Kids hope for new toys. You get older, and the toys get bigger, but the hope stays the same. Some people might hope for peace on Earth or maybe for a better tomorrow, whatever their idea of that might be, but most people still just want something bright and shiny and new.</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hy do people want so desperately not to be alone? Why is it more comforting to think you are being watched than to know that no one at all is watching? And why, really, does that make us any less alone? In the end, if there are others out there, then wouldn&#8217;t we be, all of us, still alone together?</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hen you&#8217;re little, you like to think you know everything, but the last thing you really want is to know too much. What you really want is for grownups to make the world a safe place where dreams can come true and promises are never broken. And when you&#8217;re little, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot to ask.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>eople believe what they want to believe. They find meaning where they can, and they cling to it. In the end, it really doesn&#8217;t matter what&#8217;s a trick and what&#8217;s true. What matters is that people believe.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>eople like to examine the things that frighten them, to look at them and give them names, so saints look for God, and scientists look for evidence. They&#8217;re both just trying to take away the mystery, to take away the fear.</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>e all like to think that we have some control over the events in our lives, and a lot of the time we can fool ourselves into thinking that we really are in charge. But then something happens to remind us that the world runs by its own rules and not ours and that we&#8217;re just along for the ride.</p>

<p><strong>Y</strong>ou know in cartoons, the way someone can run off a cliff and they&#8217;re fine, they don&#8217;t fall until they look down? My mom always said that was the secret of life. Never look down. But it&#8217;s more than that. It&#8217;s not just about not looking. It&#8217;s about not ever realizing that you&#8217;re in the middle of the air and you don&#8217;t know how to fly.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he world is made up of the big things that happen and the small ones. And the part that&#8217;s so unfair is that we call them &#8220;big&#8221; and &#8220;small,&#8221; because when something happens to you, when you lose something or someone that you really care about, that&#8217;s all there is. The world may be blowing up around you, but you don&#8217;t care about that. You don&#8217;t care about that at all.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> have this idea about why people do the terrible things they do. Same reason little kids push each other on the schoolyard. If you&#8217;re the one doing the pushing, then you&#8217;re not going to be the one who gets pushed. If you&#8217;re the monster, then nothing will be waiting in the shadows to jump out at you. It&#8217;s pretty simple, really. People do the terrible things they do because they&#8217;re sacred.</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>e&#8217;re all standing on the edge of a cliff, all the time, every day, a cliff we&#8217;re all going over. Our choice isn&#8217;t about that. Our choice is about whether we want to go kicking and screaming or whether we might want to open our eyes and our hearts to what happens once we start to fall.</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hat makes us human? That we can think? That we can feel sorrow and pain? Maybe. That we can laugh? I hope so. We can hurt and we can laugh, and we know a past and a present, and in some ways a future. Maybe what makes us human is that we know just enough to think and know where we&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> asked my dad once about his dad, my grandfather. I knew he&#8217;d had some hard times, but I didn&#8217;t know a lot more than that. I said to my dad &#8216;I guess maybe he was kind of lost&#8217;. &#8216;Not lost, really,&#8221; my dad said, &#8216;but for a while, he was definitely bewildered.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> remember my mom telling me that she only went to church once, with her mother on Easter Sunday. When the minister said that the Kingdom of Heaven was within her, that scared her half to death. It meant it was all up to her. People want the comfort of strong arms. They look to the voices in their heads. To drugs. They look to the sky.</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hen I was very little, my mother would read nursery rhymes to me. I always hated &#8220;Humpty Dumpty.&#8221; That&#8217;s a very scary poem. No one knows how to put it back together again—not all the king&#8217;s horses or all the king&#8217;s men. No one wants to think that there&#8217;s anything in the world that could fall apart that badly, but of course&#8230;anything can. I guess that&#8217;s what&#8217;s so scary about &#8220;Humpty Dumpty.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> had done what I could. I tried to make the soldiers think that their plan to use me as bait hadn&#8217;t worked, that I had been taken away. I thought that if I could make them believe that I was gone, then they wouldn&#8217;t bother me anymore and I could go back to who I used to be. But too much had happened to all us by then for anything to go back to how it was.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>eople talk a lot as if the most important thing in life is to always see things for what they really are. But everything we do, every plan we make is kind of a lie. We&#8217;re closing our eyes and pretending the day won&#8217;t ever come when we won&#8217;t need to make any more plans. Hope is the biggest lie there is, and it is the best. You have to keep going as if it all mattered, or else we wouldn&#8217;t keep going at all.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>ow do you let someone go? How do you understand that that&#8217;s alright, that everything changes? How do you find a way for that to make you feel good about life instead of breaking your heart? The hardest thing you&#8217;ll ever learn is how to say good-bye.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>hey will be coming soon, coming to try to stop what was going to happen next. But maybe they could be stopped. Maybe something could happen that would make it hard for them to do what they wanted to do.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> don&#8217;t know what will happen next. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to be, what I&#8217;m going to learn, but what I do know is this—life, all life, is about asking questions, not about knowing answers. It is wanting to see what&#8217;s over the next hill that keeps us all going. We have to keep asking questions, wanting to understand. Even when we know we&#8217;ll never find the answers, we have to keep on asking the questions.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>y mother always talked to me a lot about the sky. She liked to watch the clouds in the day and the stars at night&#8230;especially the stars. We would play a game sometimes, a game called &#8220;What&#8217;s Beyond the Sky?&#8221; We would imagine darkness or a blinding light or something else that we didn&#8217;t know how to name. But of course, that was just a game. There&#8217;s nothing beyond the sky. The sky just is, and it goes on and on, and we play all of our games beneath it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在这个神奇的国家里，有很过好东西被阻止了，很多烂东西倒是放进来了。不想自己的大脑成为次品，还是要多学习新知识的，那就缺少不了Proxy这东西。</p>

<p>GoAgent 确实是个不错的东西，之前用过LocalProxy，总有些奇怪的原因导致不能用。最近在同事的微博看到了GoAgent，搭了一下，速度还真不错 :D</p>

<!--more-->


<p>我是装有GAE SDK的，自行上传App的，没有使用 GoAgent 提供的 uploader.bat。
这里简单记录一下用GAE（Google App Engine）搭建GoAgent Proxy的要点：
（最权威的指南还是去 <a href="http://code.google.com/p/goagent/">http://code.google.com/p/goagent/</a> 看最好了:p ）</p>

<ol>
<li>要装有Python2.7</li>
<li>GAE里建的APP要是新的才会支持 High Replication Datastore</li>
<li>设置 app.yaml 里的 appid</li>
</ol>


<p>配合 Chrome 的插件 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dpplabbmogkhghncfbfdeeokoefdjegm">Proxy SwitchySharp</a> 效果相当好，推荐！</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before drawing anything in a browser, ask yourself three questions:</p>

<h2>Do you need to support older browsers?</h2>

<p>If the answer is yes, then your only choice is Raphaël. It handles browsers all the way back to IE 7 and Firefox 3. Raphaël even has some support for IE 6, although some of its underlying technology cannot be implemented there.</p>

<h2>Do you need to support Android?</h2>

<p>Android doesn’t support SVG, so you’ll have to use Paper.js or Processing.js. Some rumors say that Android 4 will handle SVG, but the majority of Android devices won’t support it for years.</p>

<h2>Is your drawing interactive?</h2>

<p>Raphaël and Paper.js focus on interaction with drawn elements through clicking, dragging and touch. Processing.js doesn’t support any object-level events, so responding to user gestures is very difficult. Processing.js can draw a cool animation on your home page, but the other tools are better for interactive applications.</p>

<p>Paper.js, Processing.js and Raphaël are the leading libraries for drawing on the Web right now. A couple of others are up and coming, and you can always use Flash, but these three work well with HTML5 and have the widest support among browser vendors.</p>

<p>Choosing the right framework will determine the success of your project. This article covers the advantages and disadvantages of each, and the information you need to make the best choice.</p>

<p>All of the code in this article is open source and can be run on the demo page that accompanies this article.</p>

<p>It’s all JavaScript once the page runs, but the frameworks take different paths to get there. Raphaël is written directly in JavaScript, but Paper.js uses PaperScript, and Processing.js uses its own script. They all support Firefox, Chrome and Safari, but Internet Explorer is an issue — Paper.js and Processing.js use the canvas tag and thus require IE 9.</p>

<p>PaperScript is a JavaScript extension that makes it possible to write scripts that don’t pollute the global namespace. This cuts down on JavaScript conflicts. PaperScript also supports direct math on objects such as Point and Size: you can add two points together as if they were numbers.</p>

<p>Processing.js is based on a framework named Processing, which runs in the Java Virtual Machine. You define int and float instead of var, and you can use classes with Java-style inheritance. While the Processing.js script looks a little like Java, it’s more like JavaScript and doesn’t require many of the more complex features of Java.
Using all three libraries is easy if you have some familiarity with JavaScript.</p>

    <id>http://mindon.github.com/blog/2012/02/24/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-dot-dot-dot-magnetism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ol>
<li><p>Magnetism is familiar to every fifth grader, but describing it can confound even the most brilliant physicist.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. When asked to explain magnetism, he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM">urged his BBC interviewer to take it on faith</a> (video). After seven minutes of stonewalling, he finally said, “I really can’t do a good job, any job, of explaining magnetic force in terms of something else that you’re more familiar with because I don’t understand it in terms of anything else that you’re more familiar with.”</p></li>
</ol>


<!--more-->


<ol>
<li><p>He did break down and try for a few seconds before abandoning the attempt. Those seconds were packed with oversimplifications: “All the electrons [in a magnet] are spinning in the same direction.”</p></li>
<li><p>But who better than Feynman would have known that not all electrons spin in the same direction?</p></li>
<li><p>And they don’t actually spin. “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_%28physics%29">Spin</a>” is just a physicist’s term for the little magnetic north and south poles baked into every electron. The orientation of those poles defines the direction of the electron’s (somewhat imaginary) rotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does every electron have those poles? As soon as someone finds out, we’ll get back to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Here is what we do know. Within an atom, each electron is usually paired with an opposite- oriented electron so that their magnetic pulls cancel each other out.</p></li>
<li><p>But if some of the electrons are unpaired, they can be induced to move around so that their poles line up, creating a net magnetic field. The arrangement of the electrons in metals makes them particularly open to magnetic peer pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>DIY refrigerator magnet: Apply an external magnetic field to some hot metal. Cool it so the aligned electrons get frozen in place. Slap on your local plumber’s business card, and—voilà!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/653297/yinyang">Yin Seeks Yang</a> for Magnetic Relationship. All magnets have north and south poles, and opposite poles attract: North poles seek south poles seek north poles seek south poles seek . . .</p></li>
<li><p>You are standing on a magnet right now. The earth’s magnetic field is created by electric currents in an ocean of molten iron at its core. That’s why the north pole of a compass needle points . . . er . . . why north? Since north poles are attracted to south poles, the “north” arrow on your compass actually points toward the earth’s south magnetic pole, which is the one up north. Got it?</p></li>
<li><p>And the earth’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole">magnetic south</a> (aka “north”) pole isn’t even precisely at the geographic north pole. Right now it is in the Arctic Ocean, near northern Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>Worse still, it is constantly drifting in response to currents in the earth’s core. It is moving toward Siberia at a rate of up to 35 miles per year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Hey, shift happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Ancient mariners navigated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone">lodestone</a>, naturally occurring magnetic rocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Where lodestones come from is another mystery of magnetism. Some geologists think they are created when lighting strikes iron-rich rocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Microbes, birds, and some other animals have magnetic crystals inside their bodies that allow them to orient themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>That is probably why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle">loggerhead turtles</a> can migrate 8,000 miles in unfamiliar waters while humans can get lost looking for the restroom at Olive Garden.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</a> (MRI) machines generate a field 60,000 times as intense as the earth’s to vibrate the hydrogen atoms in your body; in response, the atoms emit radio waves that are analyzed to produce a map of your insides.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a sensor the size of a sugar cube, researchers from the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/index.html">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> can <a href="http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/magnetic_101310.cfm">track the magnetic pattern of a human heart</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The signal is faint, but the good news is that science has proved attraction is quantifiable. Word up, Hallmark.</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A water layer was sprinkled with Thymol Blue, which established the Marangoni convection responsible for the evident fine-scale texture. The layer was lit from below, giving the flow a natural luminescence. Stopping vortices shed during the deceleration phase of the strider&#8217;s motion are evident in Figure 2.  The dipolar vortices shed by the driving legs during each stroke are evident in Figure 3, and mark the path of the strider. The starburst in Figure 3 is associated with the relatively large particle of thymol blue evident at its centre: the Thymol Blue reduces the local surface tension, thus prompting surface divergence that clears the surface of blue dye.  The water striders are light-seeking, and so drawn to the starbursts.</p>

<h2>Key-values Stores</h2>

<p>Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant, Redis, Voldemort, Oracle BDB</p>

<p>Content caching (Focus on scaling to huge amounts of data, designed to handle massive load), logging, etc.</p>

<p>Strengths: Fast lookups
Weaknesses: Stored data has no schema</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Column Family Stores</h2>

<p>Cassandra, HBase, Riak</p>

<p>Distributed file systems</p>

<p>Strengths: Fast lookups, good distributed storage of data
Weaknesses: Very low-level API</p>

<h2>Document Databases</h2>

<p>CouchDB, MongoDB</p>

<p>Web applications (Similar to Key-Value stores, but the DB knows what the Value is)</p>

<p>Strengths: Tolerant of incomplete data
Weaknesses: Query performance, no standard query syntax</p>

<h2>Graph Databases</h2>

<p>Neo4J, InfoGrid, Infinite Graph</p>

<p>Social networking, Recommendations (Focus on modeling the structure of data - interconnectivity)</p>

<p>Strengths: Graph algorithms e.g. shortest path, connectedness, n degree relationships, etc.
Weaknesses: Has to traverse the entire graph to achieve a definitive answer. Not easy to cluster.</p>
